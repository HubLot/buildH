VERY URGENT
- Make github issues instead of this TODO 

URGENT
DONE - Manage residue name with 4 letters (also in PDB)
- In fonction buildH_on_1C(), we have a line like that :
`typeofH2build, helper1_name, helper2_name = dic_lipids.POPC[atom.name]`
   --> change this so that it is more general (if we want to use another lipid or
       anoter dic specified by the user
- Think about : how to make the user select only a part of the H to rebuild
   --> for now, easy solution : use another dict_lipid.py

LESS URGENT
- Do we need the sign of the angle in function calc_angle ? Ask Am√©lie
- Finish general docstring
DONE - C-H bond length should be added as a constant!!!
DONE - Why does it not work with 200POPC.pdb ???
- For CH2 name the two hydrogens HR and HS
- StringIO() does'nt work when the user does not want an output pdb with H
